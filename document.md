# Draw Circles

## Demands

Start with a single window containing a grid of $20\times20$ points.

All points start out grey.

The user click to place the center of a circle, drag to set its radius. At the same time, the circle should be drawn.

When releasing the mouse button, highlight the points (make them blue) that correspond to the edge of the circle.

Two additional circles should be created corresponding to the largest and smallest radius of the highlighted points.



## Environment

Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS, Vim, Python 3.6.8, wxPython 4
